Two elements of a binary search tree (BST) are swapped by mistake.

Recover the tree without changing its structure.


Note:
A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you devise a constant space solution?


 /*   6
        /  \
       10    2
      / \   / \
     1   3 7  12
     10 and 2 are swapped
